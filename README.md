# courthouse

LLM-powered mock courtroom simulator.

## Quick Start
1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Run a simple demo (requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` or compatible endpoint):
   ```
   npm start
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in a browser to view the basic 3D courtroom built with three.js.

See [docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md) for the multi-phase development plan.
