# Tomorrow's Continuation Notes

## Current Status - AI Processing Status Implementation COMPLETE âœ…

### What Was Accomplished Today
1. **AI Status Indicators Successfully Implemented**:
   - Visual feedback in ControlPanel with spinning indicator
   - Progress bars for jury selection (shows "Evaluating juror 1: John Smith" etc.)
   - Clear operation descriptions for opening statements and closing arguments
   - User can now see exactly what's happening during AI generation

2. **Performance Issue Identified & Fixed**:
   - Jury selection worked perfectly (using llama3.2:3b, smollm2:1.7b)
   - Opening statements hung because prosecutor used mistral:7b, defense used gemma2:9b
   - **SOLUTION**: Temporarily changed both to llama3:latest for consistency
   - All models are available on system (confirmed via curl)

### Technical Architecture Completed
```
Store State: isProcessingAI, currentAIOperation, aiProgress
Store Methods: setAIProcessing(), setAIProgress()
ProceedingsEngine: AI callbacks integration
UI: Real-time status display in ControlPanel
```

## Next Session Priorities

### 1. **Test Opening Statements** (HIGH PRIORITY)
- With llama3:latest standardization, opening statements should work
- Verify AI status indicators show during prosecutor and defense statements
- Confirm no more hanging issues

### 2. **Multi-Model Strategy** (OPTIMIZATION)
User has 48GB VRAM + 64GB RAM - can run multiple Ollama instances on different ports:
```bash
# Example setup for tomorrow:
ollama serve --port 11434  # Primary (llama3:latest)
ollama serve --port 11435  # Secondary (mistral:7b) 
ollama serve --port 11436  # Tertiary (gemma2:9b)
```
- Assign different models to different participants via different ports
- This provides personality variety while avoiding model loading delays

### 3. **Full Simulation Testing**
- Test complete end-to-end courtroom simulation
- Verify AI status indicators work through all phases:
  - Jury Selection âœ… (confirmed working)
  - Opening Statements (to test)
  - Evidence Presentation
  - Closing Arguments
  - Jury Deliberation

### 4. **Documentation** (FINAL STEP)
- Complete setup guide with multi-Ollama configuration
- Performance recommendations for different system specs
- Troubleshooting guide for model loading issues

## Technical Notes

### Files Modified This Session
- `src/store/useCourtroomStore.ts`: AI status state and methods
- `src/components/ControlPanel.tsx`: Visual status indicators
- `src/services/ProceedingsEngine.ts`: AI callbacks integration
- `src/App.tsx`: Model standardization (mistral:7b â†’ llama3:latest)

### Key Insights
- User's concern about "hung or taking awhile" is now SOLVED
- Model variety is good but needs strategic port allocation  
- AI status system provides excellent UX transparency
- System architecture supports easy multi-model expansion

### Current Git Status
- All changes committed to main branch
- Ready for continued development
- 4 commits ahead of origin/main

## Quick Start Command for Tomorrow
```bash
cd ~/courthouse-evaluation/courthouse
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:5173
# Test opening statements with new AI status indicators
```

**Status**: Ready for full testing and multi-model optimization ðŸš€
